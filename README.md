# Udacity Data Science Nanodegree Project Portfolio
It contains all the projects i've done in the Udacity Data scientist Nanodegree program.

# Overview
The nanodegree takes the students through all skills necessary to become a successful Data Scientist. student will work on projects designed by industry experts, and learn to run data pipelines, design experiments, build recommendation systems, and deploy solutions to the cloud.

1. **Solving Data Science Problems:**
Learn the data science process, including how to build effective data visualizations, and how to communicate with various stakeholders.

2. **Software Engineering for Data Scientists:**
Develop software engineering skills that are essential for data scientists, such as creating unit tests and building classes.

3. **Data Engineering for Data Scientists:**
Learn to work with data through the entire data science process, from running pipelines, transforming data, building models, and deploying solutions to the cloud.

4. **Experiment Design and Recommendations:**
Learn to design experiments and analyze A/B test results. Explore approaches for building recommendation systems.

5. **Data Science Capstone Project:**
Leverage what youâ€™ve learned throughout the program to build your own open-ended Data Science project. This project will serve as a demonstration of your valuable abilities as a Data Scientist.
