# StackOverFlow-Survey-2017
I have used data from StackOverflow 2017 Annual Developers Survey, to get a closer look at the questions. This survey conducted on many developers and contains over 64,000 reviews, from all over the world.

# Installation
There should be no libraries necessary to run the code here after anaconda is distributed to Python. The code should work without problems using Python versions 3.
# Project Motivation
For this project, I was interestested in using Stack Overflow data from 2017 to better understand:

* <span style='color:darkslategray'> **What is the most common programming language used in the middle east?**
   
* <span style='color:darkslategray'> **Which Majors Have the highest Job Satisfaction In the middle East?**

* <span style='color:darkslategray'> **Which Majors Have the highest Salary In the middle East?**
   
# File Descriptions
There is a notebook is available here to view work related to the above questions. The exploratory notebook searches through data to answer questions.

# Results
The main findings of the code can be found at the post available [here](https://medium.com/@Lzcv2/developers-in-the-middle-east-c15f74f86111).
